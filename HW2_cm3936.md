**Problem 1: NYC Transit Data**

``` r
nyvtransit = read.csv("subwaydata1.csv") |>
janitor::clean_names()

select(nyvtransit, line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)

nyvtransit %>%
  mutate(
    entry = case_match(entry, "YES" ~ 1, "NO" ~ 0, .default=as.logical(NA))
  )
```

The data set contains various variables about the subway stops in the
New York City subway stations and their locations. The variables include
the line, station name, latitude and longitude, the route it runs on,
whether it is compliant with the ADA, whether it travels north to south
or east to west. The data set after my cleaning steps includes the line,
name of the station, the latitude and longitude of the station, the
routes, entry, vending and the type of entrance. My data cleaning steps
include the cleaning up the names of the columns using the ‘janitor’
package, selecting specific variables to view, and changing the entry
variable from a character to a logical variable. The remaining rows and
columns are the stations and the variables: line, name of the station,
the latitude and longitude of the station, the routes, entry, vending
and the type of entrance, repectively.

**How many distinct stations are there?**

``` r
distinct(nyvtransit, .keep_all = FALSE)
```

There are 1868 distinct train stations in NYC.

**How many stations are ADA compliant?**

``` r
nyvtransit %>%
  mutate(
    ada = case_match(ada, TRUE ~ 1, FALSE ~ 0, .default=as.logical(NA))
  )

filter(nyvtransit, ada==1)
```

There are 468 stations that are ADA compliant.

**What proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance?**

``` r
no_vending=filter(nyvtransit,vending=="NO")
  
filter(no_vending,entry=="YES")
```

The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow
entrance is 0.38.
